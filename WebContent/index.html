			<li><h2>What is Muro.Cash?</h2>
				<p>Muro.Cash is a set of tools which makes it easy to build Paywalls on Websites with large amount of data.</p>
				<p>
					At the moment it has been designed to work on the Spring Boot framework. It is still an alpha version and <strong>works only on Chrome for PC-s</strong>
					(and derivatives like Chromium or Edge) Browsers.

			<li><h2>Advantages</h2>
				<p>Muro.Cash has many advantages over other PayWall systems:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><h3>Privacy</h3>
						<p>Users do not need to give any personal data, like e-mail addresses, phone numbers or their full names, when they pay for the content.</p>
					<li><h3>Micropayments</h3>
						<p>Muro.Cash takes advantage of the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Blockchain, which brings under one cent transaction fees. This allows payments of a few cents,
							so the users can pay only for a little amount of pages, instead of having to spend many dolars in a subscription.</p>
